# LegendaryAutosplitter
This project is a LiveSplit Autosplit Script for the game Legendary (2008) by Spark Unlimited. The script supports the following features:

## Start
The script will start the timer when the player gains control at the start of the first episode.

## Split
The script will split whenever a new checkpoint is reached in the game.

## Reset
The script will reset the timer whenever a new game is started OR the first episode is loaded from the main menu.

## Load Removal
The script will pause the timer during manually triggered loads (which may be negligible on fast systems). The timer will *not* pause during cutscenes, which serve as load screens between checkpoints when playing through the game sequentially.
